# pdv-me
Partner data validation for Maine, from VEST 2016. 

Our final validation report for this dataset is available [here](https://redistrictingdatahub.org/dataset/vest-2016-maine-precinct-and-election-results/).

We do not have the raw data sources available on this Github due to file constraints, but we are happy to share them if needed.
